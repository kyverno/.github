Kyverno (Œ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩœé, Greek for "govern") is a cloud native policy management solution for Kubernetes and other environments. Kyverno can validate, mutate, generate, and clean-up resources. It can also verify OCI container images for supply chain security. Kyverno policies are delarative and do not require learning a new programming language.

GitHub is Kyverno's home and here you can find all the interesting things the Kyverno community are working on.
